A markdown template of README.md for GitHub repositories that focuses on consistent design and well-structured content. This template tries to use markdown syntax throughout the template to keep the code cleaner and maintainable. A set of images/screenshot resolutions and some other standards are recommended below to maintain a consistent layout while trying to make screenshots readable.

## Standards
The following are recommendations on how to handle images/screenshots during editing:
- The width resolution is recommended to be followed to maintain a consistent design and avoid images from stacking vertically.
- The height resolution can vary, but is it recommended to keep every image/screenshot resolution identical in a single row.
- If there is a large gap between images/screenshots in a single row, try to order them from tallest to smallest.

### Logo Resolution
- **Thumbnail** - `25x25`

### Landscape Resolution
- **Single** - `width: 640px`
- **Double** - `width: 400px`
- ~~**Triple** - `width: 264px` not recommended.~~

### Portrait Resolution
- **Single** - `width: 264px`
- **Double** - `width: 264px`
- **Triple** - `width: 264px`
